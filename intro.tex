In this report we will write about the experiment done during the first and second weeks of August in order to measure one "line"` in the visible part of the absorption spectrum (ATMOSPHERIC BAND/B-BAND?) of the Oxygen molecule using the photoacoustic effect. In order to excite the oxygen molecular orbitals we used a diode laser tuned with an external cavity. INSERT SMALL RESUME OF THE REPORT? FOR EXAMPLE (IN CHAPTER 1 WE WILL TALK ABOUT BLABLA, IN CHAMPTER 2 ABOUT BLIBLI ETC?)
